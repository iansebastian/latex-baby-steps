	\paragraph{Thoughts}
	Holy crap, that ended ugly. Why are those random vertical lines there? Man, screw \LaTeX.
	
	\newpage
	\section{The Better Option: Building tables with {\tt \textbackslash booktabs.}}
	\subsection{The basics}
	It looks like this.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{Example of table using {\tt booktabs}.}
			\label{tab:table3}
			\begin{tabular}{l|S|r}
				\toprule % <-- Creates top rule here.
				\textbf{Value 1} & \textbf{Value 2} & \textbf{Value 3} \\
				$\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ \\
				\midrule
				1 & 1234.1234 & $A$ \\
				2 & 10.234324 & $B$ \\
				3 & 5324.623  & $\Gamma$ \\
				\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	\paragraph{}Pretty neat, eh? You can see that the box borders are more polished and better-looking overall.  Using OG commands like '$|$' and {\tt'\textbackslash hline'} is discouraged in {\tt booktabs}, as there's a better replacement for it. Using '$|$' here creates a blocky vertical line, which looks like the one in Table \ref{tab:table3}.

	\newpage	
	\subsection{Multi-page tables}
	Exactly what it says, this one's a table spanning multiple pages. The environment used  is {\tt longtable}.

	\begin{longtable}[c]{cccc}
		\caption{A \LaTeX \, recreation of a famous scene in the Jack Nicholson classic, "The Shining".}
		\label{tab:Johnny}\\
		\toprule
		\textbf{Value 1} & \textbf{Value 2} & \textbf{Value 3} & \textbf{Value 4} \\
		$\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ & $\delta$ \\
		\midrule
		\endfirsthead % <-- This denotes the end of the header, which will only be shown on the first page.
		$\alpha$ & $\beta$ & $\gamma$ & $\delta$ \\
		\midrule
		\endhead % <-- Everyting between \endfirsthead and \endhead will be displayed as header for all the remaining pages.

	\subparagraph{}Okay, in retrospect, that was an obnoxious move. Still, I regret nothing.
		\subsection{Landscape tables}
	You can see them on the next page. I have no idea how to make it stay on the same page. Really quite the problem child, the bad apple, this.
