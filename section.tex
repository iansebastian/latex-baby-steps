\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
	\section{Section}
	Hello World! I am conquering you in 59 days, so do prepare for your final moments.
	
	\subsection{Subsection}
	Structuring a document is easier than I thought, but still hard and annoying as fu-
	
	\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
	Well, this is a sub-subsection $-$ a subsection of a subsection. This is as deep as it goes.
	
	\paragraph{Paragraph}
	I'm just a paragraph... nothing quite out of the ordinary. Moving on...
	
	\subparagraph{Subparagraph}
	Now this is getting ridiculous. This is a subparagraph, which means it's a paragraph \textbf{inside} a paragraph.
	
	\section{Another section}
	That's about it for this tutorial. This structure alone can take you places in your \LaTeX journey.
