One day, this will become a tutorial in LaTeX! Personally the best way to learn the code is through imitation and sheer amount of trial-and-error, so for prospective viewers out there, this is a learning-by-doing type of project. Because of that, all material is only available in .TEX and .PDF format -- script and result. Rev up your LaTeX muscles and get ready to learn!

Most of these materials are up to this moment taken from https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/ where I get my \LaTeX basics. Check them out too, they're also a good place to start.
